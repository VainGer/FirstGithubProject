    <blockquote>"You might belong in Hufflepuff,

        â€” Sorting Hat</blockquote>
    Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the
    medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard work,
    dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.

    The emblematic animal was a badger, and yellow and black were its house colours. The Head of Hufflepuff was
    Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was the House's patron ghost.

    Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth, and it was for that reason that the House colours were
    chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. The Hufflepuff point hourglass contained
    yellow diamonds. Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrated strong abilities in Herbology, owing to
    their correspondence to earth.
