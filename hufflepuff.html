                        Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the
                        medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses, valuing hard
                        work,
                        dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members.
        
                        The emblematic animal was a badger, and yellow and black were its house colours. The Head of Hufflepuff
                        was
                        Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was the House's patron ghost.

                        Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth, and it was for that reason that the House
                        colours were
                        chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. The Hufflepuff point hourglass
                        contained
                        yellow diamonds. Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrated strong abilities in Herbology, owing
                        to
                        their correspondence to earth.
