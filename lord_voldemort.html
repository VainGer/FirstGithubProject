    <blockquote>"You see? It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course.
        You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar
        Slytherin himself, through my mother's side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even
        before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry. I fashioned myself a new name, a
        name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the
        world!"
        — Tom Riddle's transformation into Lord Voldemort</blockquote>
    Tom Marvolo Riddle (31 December 1926 - 2 May 1998), later known as Lord Voldemort or, alternatively as the Dark
    Lord, You-Know-Who, or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was an English half-blood wizard considered to have been the most
    powerful and dangerous Dark wizard of all time. He was amongst the greatest wizards to have ever lived,
    rivalled only by Albus Dumbledore. Descended from Salazar Slytherin on his mother's side through the
    House of Gaunt, Tom Riddle was conceived whilst his father, Tom Riddle Senior, was under the effects of a love
    potion supplied by his mother, Merope Gaunt. When the enchantment was lifted, Tom's father abandoned his pregnant
    wife and returned to Little Hangleton. His mother died within an hour of giving birth to him. Before she died, she
    stated that her son was to be named after his father (Tom) and maternal grandfather, Marvolo Gaunt. Tom was raised
    in the Muggle-run Wool's Orphanage.

    Tom began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1938 and was immediately sorted into Slytherin
    house. During this time, Tom discovered his heritage and adopted pure-blood supremacist ideals. Tom opened the
    Chamber of Secrets and used its monster, the Basilisk, to attack Muggle-born students, resulting in the death of
    Myrtle Warren. He began his quest to attain immortality between the years of 1943 and 1998, creating his first
    Horcrux at the age of sixteen. While attending Hogwarts, Tom Riddle was made a prefect in 1942 until his graduation
    in 1945.

    Tom spent several months as a purchasing agent for the Dark artefacts shop Borgin and Burkes before disappearing.
    Splitting his own spirit into a total of eight fragments, Tom created an unprecedented seven Horcruxes, with one
    made later in his life, unintentionally and without his knowledge — Harry Potter. Tom re-emerged several decades
    later having abandoned his 'Muggle' name and becoming the self-proclaimed Lord Voldemort, an anagram of his birth
    name. In the First and Second Wizarding Wars, he commanded a veritable army of wizards and Dark creatures; committed
    countless murders and atrocities; and eventually succeeded in taking over the British Ministry of Magic.

    Voldemort was ripped from his body in 1981 after attempting to kill Harry Potter. Although unable to die, he was
    unable to regain a permanent and physical body until 1995, thus spending the intervening fourteen years as 'a shell,
    less than the meanest ghost'. He was finally killed by his own backfired Killing Curse after Harry Potter and Albus
    Dumbledore succeeded in destroying all of his Horcruxes.

    Unknown to most, however, Voldemort's legacy and bloodline would live on through his daughter Delphini, whom he
    conceived with his loyal follower Bellatrix Lestrange. The conception is thought to have occurred sometime after the
    Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996 and before Voldemort's death at Harry's hands in 1998.

    Riddle's broken and mutilated soul was then trapped in limbo for eternity, unable to move on to the afterlife or
    even return as a disembodied spirit.
