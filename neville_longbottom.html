    <blockquote>"I'll join you when hell freezes over! Dumbledore's Army!"
        â€” Neville bravely rejecting Voldemort's offer to join him</blockquote>
    Professor Neville Longbottom (b. 30 July 1980) was a British pure-blood wizard, the only child and son of
    Frank and Alice Longbottom. Neville's parents were well-respected Aurors and members of the original Order of the
    Phoenix until they were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and three other Death Eaters with the
    Cruciatus Curse when he was about sixteen months old. They were placed in the Janus Thickey Ward at St Mungo's
    Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, leaving Neville to be raised by his paternal grandmother, Augusta
    Longbottom.

    At the time of his birth, Neville was marked by a prophecy as being one of two children with the potential to defeat
    Lord Voldemort, the most powerful and feared Dark wizard in the world. However, Voldemort's first attempt to
    circumvent the prophecy by killing Neville's later friend and classmate Harry Potter, ultimately established Harry
    as Voldemort's nemesis.

    Neville began school at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991 and was sorted into Gryffindor House,
    along with Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasley. Throughout his school years, he was mostly a shy,
    clumsy, introverted boy who was constantly being told by his grandmother that he was not good enough or living up to
    his parents' accomplishments. However, in his later years, he showed that he possessed great courage and
    perseverance: he became an important member of Dumbledore's Army, an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter
    with the goal of helping other students learn spells to attack and defend themselves.

    Neville would later fight in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries (1996), the Battle of the Astronomy Tower
    (1997), and the Battle of Hogwarts (1998). During the Battle of Hogwarts, having refused Voldemort's invitation to
    join the Death Eaters, he destroyed the seventh and final Horcrux when he beheaded the snake Nagini. He also co-led
    the D.A. during his final year in opposition to the Death Eater professors.

    After the end of the Second Wizarding War, Neville briefly served as an Auror, before becoming the Herbology
    professor and the Head of Gryffindor House at Hogwarts and marrying Hannah Abbott from Hufflepuff. He was also
    the godfather of Harry and Ginny's second son, Albus Potter.
