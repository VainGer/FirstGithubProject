    <h1>Harry Potter</h1>

    <h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</h2>

    <img src=" ./images/Philosopher Stone.webp" alt="Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone">

    <p>Adaptation of the first of J.K. Rowling's popular children's novels about Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his
        eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his
        own. He is summoned from his life as an unwanted child to become a student at Hogwarts, an English boarding
        school for wizards. There, he meets several friends who become his closest allies and help him discover the
        truth about his parents' mysterious deaths.</p>

    <h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2>

    <img src="./images/Chamber of Secrets.webp" alt="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">

    <p>The second instalment of boy wizard Harry Potter's adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,
        based on the novel by JK Rowling. A mysterious elf tells Harry to expect trouble during his second year at
        Hogwarts, but nothing can prepare him for trees that fight back, flying cars, spiders that talk and deadly
        warnings written in blood on the walls of the school.</p>


    <h2>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h2>

    <img src="./images/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban.webp" alt="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">

    <p>Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts starts off badly when he learns deranged killer Sirius
        Black has escaped from Azkaban prison and is bent on murdering the teenage wizard. While
        Hermione's cat torments Ron's sickly rat, causing a rift among the trio, a swarm of
        nasty Dementors is sent to protect the school from Black. A mysterious new teacher helps Harry learn to defend
        himself, but what is his secret tie to Sirius Black?</p>

    <h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2>

    <img src="./images/Goblet.webp" alt="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">

    <p>The fourth movie in the Harry Potter franchise sees Harry returning for his fourth year at
        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, along with his friends, Ron and Hermione. There is an upcoming
        tournament between the three major schools of magic, with one participant selected
        from each school by the Goblet of Fire. When Harry's name is drawn, even though he is not eligible and is a
        fourth player, he must compete in the dangerous contest.</p>

    <h2>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</h2>

    <img src="./images/OOTP_poster_02_The_Rebellion_Begins.webp" alt="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">

    <p>Now in his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry learns that many in the wizarding community do not
        know the truth of his encounter with Lord Voldemort. Cornelius Fudge, minister of Magic, appoints his toady,
        Dolores Umbridge, as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, for he fears that professor Dumbledore will take his
        job. But her teaching is deficient and her methods, cruel, so Harry prepares a group of students to defend the
        school against a rising tide of evil.</p>


    <h2>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h2>
    <img src="./images/Half Blood.webp" alt="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">
    <p>As Death Eaters wreak havoc in both Muggle and Wizard worlds, Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for students.
        Though Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) suspects there are new dangers lurking within the castle walls, Dumbledore is
        more intent than ever on preparing the young wizard for the final battle with Voldemort. Meanwhile, teenage
        hormones run rampant through Hogwarts, presenting a different sort of danger. Love may be in the air, but
        tragedy looms, and Hogwarts may never be the same again.</p>

    <h2>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</h2>

    <img src="./images/Deathly_Hallows_1.webp" alt="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">

    <p>Without the guidance and protection of their professors, Harry, Rowling and
        Hermione begin a mission to destroy the Horcruxes, the sources of Voldemort's immortality. Though
        they must rely on one another more than ever, dark forces threaten to tear them apart. Voldemort's Death Eaters
        have seized control of the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts, and they are searching for Harry -- even as he and
        his friends prepare for the ultimate showdown.</p>
