    <blockquote>"Albus Severus, you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was
        the bravest man I've ever known."
        — Harry Potter's high opinion of Snape's character</blockquote>
    Professor Severus Snape (9 January 1960 - 2 May 1998) was an English half-blood wizard serving as Potions
    Master (1981-1996), Head of Slytherin House (1981-1997), Defence Against the Dark Arts professor (1996-1997), and
    Headmaster (1997-1998) of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as well as a member of the Order of the
    Phoenix and a Death Eater. His double life played an extremely important role in both of the Wizarding Wars against
    Voldemort.

    The only child of Muggle Tobias Snape and witch Eileen Snape (née Prince), Severus was raised in the Muggle dwelling
    of Spinner's End, which was in close proximity to the home of the Evans family, though in a poorer area. He met Lily
    and Petunia Evans when he was nine. He fell deeply in love with Lily upon their meeting and became a close friend of
    hers.

    Severus started at Hogwarts with Lily in 1971, where he was sorted into Slytherin House. This put him in the same
    year as Lily but unfortunately for him she was sorted into Gryffindor House. Severus became the immediate enemy of
    James Potter and Sirius Black and was a frequent victim of their bullying. This led him to be irritable towards
    James's son Harry when he was a professor. Snape, when young, developed a passion for the Dark Arts, which increased
    as his desire for revenge against his bullies grew stronger.

    Snape became involved with the bullies in Slytherin House, many of whom were pure-blood supremacists. This put his
    friendship with Lily, a Muggle-born, under great strain until it was eventually broken in their fifth year. In
    a misguided attempt to win back Lily's affections, Snape joined the Death Eaters along with a group of his
    fellow Slytherins.

    Severus was made a member of the Slug Club presumably because of his talent in Potion-making. Horace Slughorn even
    kept a picture of him as a student, clutching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. However, Horace did not actually
    have many hopes for Severus's future, as his photograph was kept behind many others.

    As an active Death Eater, one of Snape's biggest contributions was letting Lord Voldemort know about the prophecy
    Sybill Trelawney made to Dumbledore. This part of the prophecy could have applied to either Harry Potter or Neville
    Longbottom, who was also born at the end of July 1980 to parents who were members of the Order. Once Lord Voldemort
    decided to target the Potters over the Longbottoms, Snape begged Voldemort to at least spare Lily. Voldemort agreed,
    then did not follow through on this promise.

    Shortly before Lily Evans was murdered by Lord Voldemort, Snape changed sides and became a member of the Order of
    the Phoenix as well as a double agent during the Second Wizarding War. With tremendous difficulty, Snape prevented
    Lord Voldemort from learning the truth about his loyalties.

    Despite the opinions of most others including Harry during his early life, Albus Dumbledore trusted Snape for
    reasons that were kept between them both until their deaths. Despite Snape killing Dumbledore, it is learned that
    they had a special agreement for him to do so. When he died, it was revealed that his deep strong love for Lily
    Evans caused him to redeem himself, joining Dumbledore's cause for her protection (and, after her death, that of her
    son) from Lord Voldemort.

    The relationship between Dumbledore and Snape would be one of unusually strong loyalty, so much so that Snape agreed
    to kill Dumbledore upon the latter's own request. Before Dumbledore's death, Snape promised to protect the students
    of Hogwarts from the Death Eaters, who would inevitably take control of the Ministry of Magic as well as the
    school.

    Snape later participated in the Battle of Hogwarts but was murdered by Lord Voldemort who mistakenly believed that
    Snape was the master of the Elder Wand (an immensely strong and powerful wand that Voldemort deeply desired, as well
    as one of the Deathly Hallows) when in reality, Harry Potter was the master of the Elder Wand, because Draco
    Malfoy had disarmed Dumbledore on the night of Dumbledore's death on top of the Astronomy Tower, and Harry had
    disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor.

    After Snape's death, Harry Potter ensured that his portrait remained at Hogwarts, honouring him as a hero, despite
    their significant personal differences. In addition, Harry later named his second son Albus Severus Potter in
    honour of Dumbledore and Severus, both of whom were an inspiration in Harry's life after the Battle of Hogwarts.
    Harry also was influenced by Severus' Hogwarts house, and freely admitted that his son Albus could choose Slytherin
    if he wished.
