                    Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series written by J.
                    K.
                    Rowling.
                    The book was first published on 26 June 1997[1] by Bloomsbury in London and was later made into a
                    film
                    of
                    the
                    same name.

                    The book was released in the United States under the name Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
                    because
                    the
                    publishers were concerned that most American readers would not be familiar enough with the term
                    "Philosopher's
                    Stone". However, this decision led to criticism by the British public who felt it shouldn't be
                    changed
                    due
                    to
                    the fact it was an English book.
                    "Harry Potter has never played a sport while flying on a broomstick. He's never worn a Cloak of
                    Invisibility,
                    befriended a half-giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life with the
                    Dursleys:
                    his
                    horrible aunt and uncle and their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny Cupboard Under the
                    Stairs,
                    he
                    hasn't had a birthday party in ten years, and his birthday present is his uncle's old socks.

                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger. A letter with an
                    invitation to a
                    wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic
                    around
                    every
                    corner, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter."
                    "Until now there's been no magic for Harry Potter. He lives with the miserable Dursleys and their
                    abominable
                    son,
                    Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny closet beneath the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in ten
                    years.
                    Then a
                    mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger. A letter with an invitation to an incredible place
                    called
                    Hogwarts
                    School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he finds not only friends, flying sports on broomsticks,
                    and
                    magic
                    in
                    everything from classes to meals.

                    Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy - until he is rescued by a beetle-eyed giant of a man,
                    enrols
                    at
                    Hogwarts
                    School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, learns to play Quidditch, and does battle in a deadly duel. The
                    Reason,
                    Harry
                    Potter is a wizard!"
