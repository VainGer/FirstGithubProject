                    Slytherin was one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by
                    Salazar
                    Slytherin.
                    In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few
                    particular
                    characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics included cunning, resourcefulness, leadership,
                    and
                    ambition.

                    Many Slytherin students tended to clique together (often acquiring leaders) which further
                    exemplified
                    Slytherin's
                    ambitious qualities. Examples of these included Draco Malfoy's gang, Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy
                    Parkinson's
                    gang and
                    Tom Riddle's gang (which later became the Death Eaters).

                    The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it
                    could be
                    a
                    factor
                    when being sorted. Students of any blood status could be placed in the house. However, a Muggle-born
                    student
                    from that house was considered to be quite rare.
                    The emblematic animal of the house was a snake and the house's colours were green and silver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were
                    two
                    notable
                    heads of the house; Horace Slughorn took the role twice (first leaving in 1981 and then taking the
                    role
                    again from
                    1997 until leaving before 2016), and Severus Snape. The patron ghost of the house was the Bloody
                    Baron.

                    Slytherin corresponded roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated
                    with
                    the
                    sea and
                    lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible
                    animals.
                    Similarly,
                    in Celtic mythology, water is seen as a portal to another world, leading some to believe that the
                    element
                    was chosen
                    to symbolise a Slytherin's dream for a world in which their goals and ambitions had finally been
                    achieved.
                    Others
                    speculate that it was chosen to symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pureblood-only wizarding
                    society.

                    The colours also corresponded with waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being
                    often
                    associated with grey rainwater.
