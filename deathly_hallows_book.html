                    Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series by J.
                    K.
                    Rowling.
                    It
                    was released on 21 July 2007 at 00:01 am local time in English-speaking countries.

                    It was followed by a sequel to the original series, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

                    The title was first released to the public through a hangman game posted by J. K. Rowling on her
                    official
                    website on
                    21 December 2006. Shortly afterwards, it was confirmed by the publishers. Rowling left a note,
                    written
                    on a
                    bust
                    of
                    Hermes in her room at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh, saying, "JK Rowling finished writing Harry
                    Potter
                    and
                    the
                    Deathly Hallows in this room (652) on 11th Jan 2007".
                </p>
                <p>
                    On her website she said, "While each of the
                    previous
                    Potter
                    books has strong claims on my affections, Deathly Hallows is my favourite, and that is the most
                    wonderful
                    way to
                    finish the series."
                    She has previously said that although all the books carry on the story, Deathly
                    Hallows
                    is
                    more
                    a continuation of the story in the previous book, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, than has
                    been
                    the
                    case
                    with any other book in the series. It is the fastest-selling book of all time, selling 20 million
                    copies
                    in
                    the
                    first 24 hours.[1][2]
