            Ronald Bilius "Ron" Weasley (b. 1 March 1980) was an English pure-blood wizard, the sixth and youngest son
            of
            Arthur and Molly Weasley (née Prewett). He was also the younger brother of Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred,
            George,
            and
            the elder brother of Ginny. Ron and his siblings lived at The Burrow, on the outskirts of Ottery St
            Catchpole,
            Devon.
            <br>
            Ron began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House.
            He
            soon
            became close friends with fellow student Harry Potter and later Hermione Granger. Together, they made the
            Golden
            Trio and faced many challenges during their adolescence, including keeping the Philosopher's Stone from
            Professor
            Quirinus Quirrell, rescuing Ginny from the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, saving Harry's godfather
            Sirius
            Black
            from the Dementors of Azkaban, and guiding Harry through the Triwizard Tournament.
            <br>
            He also helped form Dumbledore's Army and fought in numerous battles of the Second Wizarding War.
        </p>
        <p>
            These battles included the Battle of the Department of Mysteries (1996), Battle of the Astronomy Tower
            (1997), and Battle
            of the Seven Potters (1997). Ron also became a Gryffindor prefect and a Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch
            team
            during his fifth year at Hogwarts. He skipped his last year of school in order to accompany Harry and
            Hermione on a hunt to destroy all of Lord
            Voldemort's Horcruxes and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, during which he lost his brother Fred, a
            loss
            which devastated him and his family, especially George, Fred's twin.
            <br>
            After the war, Ron became an Auror and helped reform and revolutionise the British Ministry of Magic. After
            two
            years as an Auror, he went to work at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes with his brother George. He and Hermione
            eventually
            married and had two children, Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley. Ron was also named the godfather of James
            Sirius
            Potter, his sister Ginny Weasley's and Harry Potter's eldest child.
