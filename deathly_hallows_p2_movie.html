            Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the second instalment of a two-part film based on Harry
            Potter and
            the Deathly Hallows by J. K. Rowling, and the final film in the Harry Potter series.
            <br>
            David Yates, who directed the preceding two films, directed both parts, while Steve Kloves returned to
            script.[3]
            The first part was released internationally on 18 November 2010 and the following day in the United Kingdom
            and the
            United States, with the second released on 13 July 2011.[4] Production of the two films occurred
            concurrently,[5]
            and treated as if it were one film.[6] The idea to split the films had been around since the middle of
            2007,[3] but
            only really came into serious consideration after producer David Heyman was able to talk to writer Steve
            Kloves when
            the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike ended and Heyman had Rowling's approval.[6]
            <br>
            On 12 March 2008, Warner Bros. additionally confirmed that the film would be split into two, to do justice
            to the
            book.[7] David Yates, director of Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince will return to direct and Steve
            Kloves
            is going to write the screenplay. According to Warner Bros. executive Alan F. Horn, it will allow "an extra
            hour and
            a half to celebrate what this franchise has been and do justice to all the words and ideas in the amazing
            story."
            Heyman described the workings behind the split: "Deathly Hallows is so rich, the story so dense and there is
            so much
            that is resolved that, after discussing it with Rowling, we came to the conclusion that two parts were
            needed."[5]
            Kloves was not able to start work on the script until the WGA strike ended.[8]
            <br>
            Before David Yates was officially chosen to direct the film, others had expressed an interest in the job.
            Alfonso
            Cuarón, director of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, had said that he would be "tempted" to return
            to
            direct.[9] Guillermo del Toro, who passed on Prisoner of Azkaban, had expressed interest in directing
            Deathly
            Hallows,[10] but an increased workload ruled him out of the project.[11]
            <br>
            Heyman noted that the films will be a closer recreation of the books than the previous films because of the
            length a
            two-part adaptation entails. Daniel Radcliffe said: "This is a road film, particularly in Part One of the
            film.
            People have been so used to seeing Harry Potter at Hogwarts and we're just not there for the first part of
            the film.
            That seems to have really freshened things up, and hopefully will get people seeing the films with fresh
            eyes again,
            because it's just a totally different look when you're not just sat in the same room the whole time."[12]
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Yates had retained composer Nicholas Hooper for Half-Blood Prince, John Williams (who composed the
            scores
            to the first three films) had expressed interest in returning to score the film - however he did not state
            which
            part he would be contributing to. In January 2010 Alexandre Desplat, a French composer, was confirmed to
            produce the
            score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.[13] In November 2010 it was confirmed that Alexandre
            Desplat
            (despite many fans wanting Williams) would compose the second part. Yates and Heyman have noted that some of
            the
            events of this film had an effect on the way the sixth film was written.[14]
            <br>
            The first part of Deathly Hallows ends as Voldemort retrieves the Elder Wand from Albus Dumbledore's
            tomb.[15] This
            film starts with the trio planning the Gringotts Break-in.
            <br>
            In the wake of the success of the 3-D film Avatar in late 2009, Warner Bros. announced that the Deathly
            Hallows
            films will be converted to 3-D for showing in 3-D.[16] However, the first film was not released in 3-D due
            to time
            constraints. The second film is nonetheless being widely released in traditional 2-D as well for
            ticket-buyers who
            prefer that viewing option.
            <br>
            Deathly Hallows: Part 2 opened to critical acclaim along with instant commercial success: on the film review
            aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating of 96%. The film set many new box office
            records, including biggest opening day in the United States ($91,071,119), in the United Kingdom ($14.8
            million) and
            in 13 other countries,[17] biggest US and worldwide opening weekend ($169,189,427; $483,189,427) and biggest
            US
            midnight release ($43,500,000).[18][19]
            <br>
            Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the highest-grossing film of 2011, the 9th film in history to have grossed over
            $1
            billion (after Titanic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's
            Chest,
            The Dark Knight, Avatar, Alice in Wonderland, Toy Story 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides),
            and
            grossed $1.341 billion worldwide, which made it the third highest-grossing film of all time at the time of
            its
            release (behind Avatar and Titanic). It is currently the 13th highest-grossing film of all time.[20]
