                        Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book in the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling,
                        published in
                        2000. A film version of this book was released in November 2005. This book is seen by many fans as the
                        beginning
                        of darker times in the wizarding world, as it shows the return of Voldemort.
                        "Harry Potter is in his fourth year at Hogwarts. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys
                        and go
                        to
                        the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys.

                        He wants to find out about the mysterious
                       event to
                       take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition
                       that
                       hasn't happened for hundreds of years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But
                       unfortunately
                       for
                       Harry Potter, he's not normal - not even by Wizarding standards. And in his case, different can be
                       deadly."
