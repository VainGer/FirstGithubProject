    <blockquote>"The Rebellion Begins"
        â€” Official tagline</blockquote>
    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a British-American fantasy film based on the fifth novel by J. K.
    Rowling, released on 11 July 2007 in the U.S. and 12 July 2007 in the UK. David Yates made his directorial debut for
    the series, as did Michael Goldenberg for writing and David Barron for producing, while David Heyman returned from
    the first four films to produce. Reprising their roles from the previous films are Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint,
    Emma Watson, Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Griffiths, Jason Isaacs, Gary
    Oldman, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, David Bradley, Warwick Davis, Tom
    Felton, Robert Hardy, Julie Walters and Mark Williams, while Helena Bonham Carter, Imelda Staunton, George Harris
    and Natalia Tena make their debut for the series.

    This film is the only one of the series for which Steve Kloves did not write the screenplay. When asked why he
    turned it down, he said "You know, I don't even know why. The fourth film, Goblet of Fire, was really hard to do. I
    wrote on it for two years. But it's not that simple and I don't know that I'll ever fully understand why I didn't do
    it. This will sound glib, but it's somewhat true: They asked me on the wrong day."[1]

    The film grossed $941 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2007 (behind Pirates of the
    Caribbean: At World's End) and the sixth highest-grossing film of all time at the time (behind Titanic, The Lord of
    the Rings: The Return of the King, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, The Philosopher's Stone and At
    World's End).
