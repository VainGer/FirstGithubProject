                    Ravenclaw was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was
                    the
                    medieval
                    witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house were characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom.
                    The
                    emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze were its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw
                    was
                    Filius
                    Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.
                </p>
                <p>


                    Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element of air, and it was for that reason that the House
                    colours
                    were
                    chosen; blue and bronze represented the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do
                    with
                    air.
                    The Ravenclaw points hourglass contained blue sapphires.
