                    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth book in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter book
                    series.
                    It
                    was one
                    of the most widely-anticipated books of the series, since there was a wait of three years between it
                    and
                    the
                    previous book, Goblet of Fire. At 38 chapters, it is also the longest book in the series, having
                    jokingly
                    been
                    labelled as heavier than a refrigerator (by Stephen Fry at the Royal Albert Hall event) and used as
                    a
                    benchmark for
                    the size of the next two books.."
                    "Harry Potter is in his fifth year at Hogwarts School as the adventures continue. There is a door at
                    the
                    end
                    of a
                    silent corridor. And it's haunting Harry Potter's dreams. Why else would he be waking in the middle
                    of
                    the
                    night,
                    screaming in terror? Harry has a lot on his mind for this, his fifth year at Hogwarts: a Defence
                    Against
                    the
                    Dark
                    Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a big surprise on the Gryffindor Quidditch
                    team;
                    and
                    the
                    looming terror of the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But all these things pale next to the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, one that neither
                    the
                    magical
                    government nor the authorities at Hogwarts can stop. As the grasp of darkness tightens, Harry must
                    discover
                    the true
                    depth and strength of his friends, the importance of boundless loyalty, and the shocking price of
                    unbearable
                    sacrifice. His fate depends on them all.
                    <br>
                    The book that took the world by storm. In his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry faces challenges at
                    every
                    turn,
                    from the
                    dark threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and the unreliability of the government of the magical world
                    to
                    the
                    rise of
                    Ron Weasley as the Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch Team. Along the way he learns about the
                    strength
                    of
                    his
                    friends, the fierceness of his enemies, and the meaning of sacrifice."
