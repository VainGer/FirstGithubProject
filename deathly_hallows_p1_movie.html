    <blockquote>"Nowhere Is Safe"
        — Official tagline</blockquote>
    Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the first instalment of a two-part film based on Harry Potter and
    the Deathly Hallows by J. K. Rowling.

    David Yates, who directed the preceding two films, directed both parts, with Steve Kloves returning to script.[2]
    The first part was released on 19 November 2010, with the second following in July 2011.[3] Production of the two
    films occurred concurrently,[4] and treated as if it were one film.[5] The idea to split the films had been around
    since the middle of 2007,[2] but only really came into serious consideration after producer David Heyman was able to
    talk to writer Steve Kloves when the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike ended and Heyman had Rowling's
    approval.[5]

    On 12 March 2008, Warner Bros. additionally confirmed that the film would be split into two, to do justice to the
    book.[6] David Yates, director of Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince returned to direct and Steve Kloves
    wrote the screenplay. According to Warner Bros. executive Alan F. Horn it allowed 'an extra hour and a half to
    celebrate what this franchise has been and do justice to all the words and ideas in the amazing story.'[4] Heyman
    described the workings behind the split: 'Deathly Hallows is so rich, the story so dense and there is so much that
    is resolved that, after discussing it with Rowling, we came to the conclusion that two parts were needed.'[4] Due to
    the WGA strike, Kloves was not able to start work on the script until it ended.[7]

    Before David Yates was officially chosen to direct the film, others had expressed an interest in the job. Alfonso
    Cuarón, director of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, had said that he would be 'tempted' to return to
    direct.[8] Guillermo del Toro, who passed on Prisoner of Azkaban, had expressed interest in directing Deathly
    Hallows,[9] but an increased workload ruled him out of the project.[10]

    Heyman noted that the films would be a closer recreation of the books than the previous films because of the length
    a two-part adaptation entails.[11] Daniel Radcliffe said: 'This is a road movie, particularly in Part One of the
    film. People have been so used to seeing Harry Potter at Hogwarts and we're just not there for the first part of the
    film. That seems to have really freshened things up, and hopefully will get people seeing the films with fresh eyes
    again, because it's just a totally different look when you're not just sat [sitting] in the same room the whole
    time.'[11]

    Although Yates had retained composer Nicholas Hooper for Half-Blood Prince, John Williams (who composed the scores
    to the first three films) had expressed interest in returning to score the film - however he did not state which
    part he would be contributing to. In January 2010, French composer Alexandre Desplat was confirmed to produce the
    score for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.[12]

    Yates and Heyman have noted that some of the events of this film had an effect on the way the sixth film was
    written.[13]

    The first part ends as Lord Voldemort obtains the Elder Wand from Albus Dumbledore's tomb.[14] Interestingly,
    however, a number of media reviews of the film indicated that it ended with Harry, Hermione and Ron being captured
    by Bellatrix Lestrange.

    In the wake of the success of the 3-D film Avatar in late 2009, Warner Bros. announced that both Deathly Hallows
    films will be converted to 3-D for showing in 3-D.[15] On 9 October 2010, it was announced that Harry Potter and the
    Deathly Hallows: Part 1 would not be released in 3-D because the film would not be complete before the release. It
    is possible it could be re-released in the near future as the conversion to 3-D has already begun.[16]

    The film grossed $976 million worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film of 2010 (behind Toy Story 3 and
    Alice in Wonderland) and the eighth highest-grossing film of all time at the time (behind Avatar, Titanic, The Lord
    of the Rings: The Return of the King, Toy Story 3, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Alice in Wonderland
    and The Dark Knight).
