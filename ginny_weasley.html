    <blockquote>"Yeah, size is no guarantee of power. Look at Ginny..."
        — Ginny's impressive Bat-Bogey Hex</blockquote>

        <p>

            Ginevra Molly "Ginny" Potter (née Weasley) (b. 11 August 1981), occasionally known as Gin by Harry
            Potter, was an English pure-blood witch, the only daughter of Arthur and Molly Weasley (née Prewett), and
            the
            younger sister of Bill, Charlie, Percy, the late Fred, George and Ron. She was the first female to be born
            into the
            Weasley line for several generations. She and her older brothers grew up in The Burrow on the outskirts of
            Ottery St
            Catchpole in Devon.
            <br>
            Ginny attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1992 to 1999, a year beneath the famous Harry
            Potter,
            and was sorted into Gryffindor House. During her first year, she developed a long-standing crush on Harry
            Potter and
            came under the influence of the memory of Tom Riddle's sixteen-year-old self, who was preserved in a diary,
            which
            forced Ginny to re-open the Chamber of Secrets, endangering the lives of many students, including her own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following that ordeal, Ginny grew into a confident young woman, becoming an important member of Dumbledore's
            Army,
            an organisation taught and led by Harry Potter in her fourth year. She would later fight in the Battle of
            the
            Department of Mysteries (1996), the Battle of the Astronomy Tower (1997), and the Battle of Hogwarts (1998).
            She was
            also an accomplished Quidditch player, playing Chaser and Seeker at different times for the Gryffindor
            Quidditch
            team.
            <br>
            After the Second Wizarding War, Ginny became a professional Quidditch player for the Holyhead Harpies. Upon
            retiring
            from the Harpies, she became the senior Quidditch correspondent for the Daily Prophet. Ginny eventually
            married
            Harry Potter and the couple had three children; James Sirius (named after Harry's father and godfather),
            Albus
            Severus (named after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape), and Lily Luna Potter (named after Harry's mother
            and their
            friend Luna Lovegood). By 2020, Ginny had become the sports editor for the Daily Prophet.
