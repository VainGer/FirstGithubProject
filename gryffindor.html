                <p>
                    Gryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded
                    by
                    Godric
                    Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he
                    most
                    valued, such
                    as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination, to be sorted into his house.

                    The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold and its house point
                    hourglass
                    was
                    filled
                    with rubies. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the House
                    ghost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason that the colours
                    scarlet
                    and gold
                    were chosen to represent the house. The colour of fire corresponded to that of a lion as well, with
                    scarlet
                    representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.

                    The Gryffindor motto was "Forti Animo Estote", which was displayed on a stained glass window in the
                    common
                    room.
