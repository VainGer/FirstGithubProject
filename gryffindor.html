    <blockquote>"You might belong in Gryffindor,
        Where dwell the brave at heart,
        Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
        Set Gryffindors apart"
        â€” Sorting Hat</blockquote>
    Gryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was founded by Godric
    Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such
    as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination, to be sorted into his house.

    The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold and its house point hourglass was filled
    with rubies. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the House ghost.

    Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold
    were chosen to represent the house. The colour of fire corresponded to that of a lion as well, with scarlet
    representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.

    The Gryffindor motto was "Forti Animo Estote", which was displayed on a stained glass window in the common room.
